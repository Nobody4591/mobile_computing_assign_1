    <h1>Git and GitHub for beginners</h1>
    <p>
        Learning Git is just as easy as doing some simple commads, knowing what you've to do.
        we'll start by first creating a folder, so that we can convert it as Git repository.
        Anything you wanna keep track off, just put it in that folder, and let the know whether you wanna include that
        perticular thing or not.
    </p>
    <b>STEP 1</b>
    <p>

        let's create the folder, commad for creating the folder is:
        <br>
        <i>mkdir git_practice</i>
        <br>
        <img src="./resources/Screenshot 2021-10-10 at 6.42.12 PM.png" alt="mkdir img" width="1200" height="200">
    </p>
    <b>STEP 2</b>
    <p>
        Inititate the Git repository in the folder, the command for Inititating the repository is as simple as
        <br>
        <i>git init</i>
        <br>
        <img src="./resources/Screenshot 2021-10-10 at 6.49.57 PM.png" alt="init img" width="1200" height="500">
    </p>
    <b>STEP 3</b>

    <p>
        we've created the git repository successfully. Now, we just have to add things in the folder,<br>
        which we want to be tracked.
        <br>
        let's create a file, name <i>user_manual.html</i>
        <br>
        comand for creating the file is, <i>touch user_manual.html</i>
        <img src="./resources/Screenshot 2021-10-10 at 6.58.11 PM.png" alt="create file" width="1200" height="60">
    </p>
    <b>STEP 3</b>
    <p>
        Now, we've to understand some working of Git.
        <br>
        we've created a file in the git repository, in same way, we can add files as much as we want. there are three
        stages <br>
        for a git repository,
    <ul>
        <li>
            Add the file in git repository ( simple words, in Git negivation).
        </li>
        <li>
            Stage the current file, so we can have idea what go store in the next commit. Although,this step is optional
        </li>
        <li>
            Commit(store the file permanatly) the file in the Git negivation
        </li>
    </ul>
    while working on the files, we can check the status of files, we also have command for that.
    <br>
    let give it a try
    <br>
    we've added the file in folder but neither we, add the file git repository nor Commit
    <br>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Adding File in Git repository</b>
            <p>
                adding the file in git repository is easy with the command,
                <br>
                <i>
                    "git add 'filename'" or "git add ."
                </i>
                in our case, it like git add user_manual.html
                <br>
                <img src="./resources/Screenshot 2021-10-10 at 7.15.28 PM.png" alt="adding file" width="1100"
                    height="60">
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Stage File in git repository
            </b>
            <p>
                adding file in git is necessary but it doesn't meet the requirement. it just now track which file <br>
                is changes and where. <br>
                for the file changes to be permanat, we have to either stage the situation of File. Think it as <br>
                you wanna some more rough work today, but don't want that work to be stored or parmanent <br>
                So, stage commands will help you achieve this. <br>
                <i>
                    git stage
                </i>
                <br>

                <img src="./resources/Screenshot 2021-10-10 at 9.48.16 PM.png" alt="stage file" width="1100"
                    height="60">

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Commit the File
            </b>
            <p>
                last think we have to do is to make all the change patrmaent, git coomit command,
                <br>
                can help in this.
                <br>
                <i>
                    git commit .
                </i>
                <br>
                <img src="./resources/Screenshot 2021-10-10 at 9.53.28 PM.png" alt="commit" width="1200" height="200">
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>
        GitHub work
    </h2>
    <p>
        we're done with git work keeping things as simple as possible, now we're moving towards GitHub <br>
        GitHub is the GUI version of Git, it make the things bit simple for bigenner but the recommended is Git with
        termianl <br>
        but GitHub on the cloud provided the only storage for your local project, which too awosome. <br>

        things to do:
    <ol>
        <li>
            create GitHub account
        </li>
        <li>
            create new repository. optional
        </li>
        <li>
            connect to remote termianl
        </li>
        <li>
            push your work to the cloud
        </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    I'm ommiting the creating account STEP, only start form connecting the git to cloud
